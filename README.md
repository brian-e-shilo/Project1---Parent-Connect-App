Developed the ‘Parent Connect’ application for National Centre for Excellence School
It is the one stop solution to link parents with the school in a smarter way. It opens a gateway of easy access to view updates from 
the school, the website, email-IDs of eminent human resources of the school, share pictures and also access Educube. An added 
feature is the ‘click to call’, which allows users to call any staff member anytime and anywhere with a single click. It also serves 
as an instant communication tool for parents and the school, bridging the gap between the two and helping in the growth of the 
child and the school.
